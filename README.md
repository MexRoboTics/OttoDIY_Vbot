Mix from OttoDIY opensource Project.  
http://ottodiy.com 
You can do it yours 
## About this Library
- I mixed some changes, by Arrange C++ files in 1 library so it is easy to install in Arduino. 
- Modify to use with Bluetooth HC06 in SoftwareSerial, so you can upload code without removing the HC06 Module
- Can Programming the Otto in Scratch Language using mBlock software (Both Arduino mode and Scratch Mode)

## Installation
Just download Zip File and add manually by: Arduino/Sketch/Include Library/Add Zip Library 
After installing Library, go to Files/Examples/otto and can upload the demo programms.
